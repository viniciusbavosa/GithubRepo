# GitHub Repository Fetcher

This is a study project developed to practice my knowledge of React and TypeScript. The application consumes the GitHub API to fetch and display issues for any repository entered by the user. It includes pagination and filters to narrow down the search for issues. This project serves as a practical exercise to improve skills in API integration, React, and TypeScript.

# Studies topics

Through developing this project, I learned the basics of React and its hooks, understanding how frameworks function. Working with TypeScript underscored the importance of type safety, teaching me how to properly type my code.
